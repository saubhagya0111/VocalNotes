1,I used to see wondrous things all the time But tonight all I can think of is going in sails Where I can't seem to find me home Seem as though I'm lost on the beach all by myself Who's there? I know you're over there Who is this singing in such a creaky room? I can't make a word Simple souls can't have a word No one wants to wander forever What should I say?
